Files that contain json with possible spelling mistakes in chinese

## Summary
The most commmon spelling mistakes in chinese are:
- Choosing characters with the same pronunciation (homophone) but different meaning
- Choos characters that look quite similar, but have different meanings and pronunciation

In this repository can be found dictionaries that map a hanzi, or set of hanzis, to all others that are either homophones or look alikes.

The idea is to have a source of information that can be used to inject errors into texts and evaluate data
